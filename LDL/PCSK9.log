35 (of 35) markers to be included from [ ./PCSK9.map ]
Warning, found 1 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ ./PCSK9.nosex ]
11167 individuals read from [ ./PCSK9.ped ] 
11167 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
5570 cases, 5597 controls and 0 missing
4049 males, 7117 females, and 1 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 35 SNPs
11167 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.999378
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 35 SNPs
