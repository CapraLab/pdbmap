Detailed description:
ModBase is constantly running predicted models for proteins in Ensembl and RefSeq.
This dataset contains all of the Human models that were most up-to-date near the
end of 2013. They include both homology and ab initio (de novo) models.
The README.H_sapiens_2013.txt is very informative about where to find needed
information. The summary and .unq files are metadata for the included models
and external database idmapping to Ensembla and RefSeq.
